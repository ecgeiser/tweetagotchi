# Tweetagotchi

### GA WDI DC August 2014, Project 1

### Overview

**Tweetagotchi** is a virtual pet you care for by tweeting. It was inspired by my own struggles with tweeting regularly. I want to be engaged with webdev communities online, but when I come across something interesting or have a cool idea I tend to engage in person rather than online. Tweetagotchi provides a new (and more urgent) incentive for tweeting - keeping your pet alive.

Tweetagotchi was developed as a sample Rails project for the August 2014 Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. It was developed over a 3 day sprint to model the agile software development process.
